Bluffers,"Scarborough Bluffs, Toronto",Ontario,43.704839,-79.235285,"There's a ton of places to surf around Bluffers. A Great Lakes favourite is the Cove, which is accessed via the parking lot at the western end of Bluffers park. Park your car, and follow the path towards the water. "
Sand Banks,"Prince Edward, ON",Ontario,43.902416,-77.282812,"Don't stop at the main Sandbanks entrance, but follow the road around to the campground. In the summer you have to pay for parking, or hike from the park entrance (which is the only option in the offseason). There will be waves all the way up and down the beach"
A-Bay,"Ashbridge's Bay, Toronto",Ontario,43.656182,-79.307631,"A-bay breaks in a few places around the park. Coatsworth cut is great at size, but the beach has a few spots as well. "
Kincardine Pier,Kincardine,Huron,44.176761,-81.640928,"Park at the marina, right next to the beach. Walk to the end of the pier and jump in! There is a nice peak to the left of the pier and some more peaks furthur left. Mainly right handers but there are lefts there as well.
This place is amazing. I have surfed all over Australia, Fiji and Hawaii. This has some of the biggest stuff I have seen! Nothing compared to Hawaii, but to see a clean 10ft wave in Canada, that is amazing. The crowd is awesome, what else would you expect from Canadians!"
Pleasant Beach,Sherkston/Port Colborne,Erie,42.863438,-79.124442,"Park at the bottom of Pleasant Beach road, across from the cafe. Walk down to the beach, and then head East along the beach. It's private property, so don't be a dick."
Hutches,"Burlington, under skyway bridge",Ontario,43.296529,-79.794345,"Drive to 1149 Eastport Dr, Hamilton, Ontario. Park anywhere. Waves breaking everywheree"
Bondhead,Newcastle,Ontario,43.896962,-78.576135,"Aim for Bonhead Parkette at the bottom of Mill street, at Boulton. The current can get pretty wicked, so it's recommended to walk out to the pier and jump in, rather than paddling out. Depends on the size though. Bigger = pier."
Cobourg Pier,Cobourg,Ontario,43.955059,-78.164008,"Park at the bottom of the pier, and walk out. Be careful, as it gets Icy. On smaller days you can paddle out from the beach. On bigger days, jump off the pier, but be careful as it's shallow at some places. "
Alona Bay,Lake Superior Provincial Park,Superior,47.166601,-84.707918,"This place really breaks with a solid west wind. However, due to the depth of the water, it takes a nice size swell to get things breaking. This place won't break unless it's head-high."
Bayfield Wharf,Bayfield,Huron,43.569754,-81.709444,"The parking lot is in plain view of the waves. And the pier is long, jumping off it almost gets you past the last break. Surflines ""current wind"" forecast is always wrong for this spot, for some reason."
Birthdays,Niagara Shore Park,Ontario,43.255746,-79.115484,"Park in parking lot or on grass overlooking the bay. Watch for dogshit. If it rains forget it-the sewage plant is right next door. Probably the filthiest place ever. Works on NW over 40knots as a L pointbreak, E over 15 as a R point break, N 15-20 as a beachbreak."
Sauble Beach,Sauble Ontario,Huron,44.629377,-81.270952,"Head down Shore Point Road, and check the beach. There will be waves breaking everywhere."
D-Land,Lowbanks Ontario,Erie,42.842388,-79.481711,"Park at the end of Mohawk Point road. Paddle out from the bay near the point straight toward Buffalo into the lineup. You'll need a friend to drive the car to bring you back into lineup; some rides on a good day will take you from Dland all the way past chickencoops. Current near impossible to paddle against, unless you paddle out into the middle of the bay where the rip will take you back out to Dland. Just be cool with the landowners or they will call the cops. Watch your head, and bring a STRONG mid-sized board. YOU WILL hit the rocks. Zebra mussels will wreck your feet and wetsuit. Water smells like "
Erieau,Erieau Ontario,Erie,42.258977,-81.905287,Tonnes of parking and fairly easy to get to. The best spot will require a paddle across the channel but its not too far. The best spot hands down is the inside of the channel when its working. A really strong onshore wind will build up massive swell and push it through the channel. The waves actually build coming through and finally break on the sand bar on the east side right after the pier. Since I have found this spot it has become my favorite. There are only a few of us local surfers that go for it. I have seen it barrel at over 6ft very clean. Doesn't happen often but when it does it is incredible.
Grand Bend,Grand Bend Ontario,Huron,43.315601,-81.764917,Drive into Grand Bend and find the water...head to the pier. Best spot is the south side of the pier. Either jump off the pier of drive down to the second set of lights and turn right (towards the water). Free parking at the end. (parking can get crowded)
Inverhuron-Mac Point,Inverhuron / MacGregor Point Provincial Park,Huron,44.296274,-81.600989,Big Beach. Big Waves. Can be busy during peak summer months with cottagers. Small to no crowds the rest of the year. Parking available at MacGregor Point Provincal Park. When Park is closed beach is accessible in Inverhuron. Rock shelf on south and north side of bay. Also small reef in middle. Do a couple of passes to scout before goign crazy on the waves. Bay has larger waves on North side next to Gunn Point. Bring your surfboard. Works best on any wind with a West in it.
Lang's Left,Toronto (Leslie Street Spit),Ontario,43.617844,-79.326423,"Have to walk a long way (ditch your car at Unwin), but it's worth it. A true left point on Lake Ontario! Nice long wall to play on, with fast sections. One of the sections WILL catch up with you and beat you down, but the water is plenty deep so you don't need to worry about hitting bottom. Overall a great spot, and my #1 go-to on an E gale. It starts working at about 20-25 kt, and gets EPIC on anything over 30 kt."
Patterson Park,Kingston Ontario,Ontario,44.209351,-76.562414,"Clearly needs a very specific wind. City of Kingston Ontario. Take King street, turn on Sunny Acres Road, to the end there's a small park behind the water plant. Need a good wind from the S-W or the S-SW. Difficult to surf, need a good timming. Waves break every 6 seconds."
South Hampton ,South Hampton Ontario,Huron,44.498519,-81.376456,"Head down to South Hampton, Onatrio. Just go find a nice spot on the beach where the wave are good. The waves are usually only good on windy days and before and after a storm."
The Hill,West of Port Colborne Ontario,Erie,42.878459,-79.305092,"At Quarry rd. and Lakeshore. Easy spot, fun, good for longboarders but sucks for shortboards. Holds up to shoulder high before closing out and current gets too strong. First granted access and surfed by DrD and Steve M in 1995. Very Private access-the landowners will call cops if you are a jerk. Old faithful, always fun any time the bouy in PC reads between 1 and 3 feet. Over 20knots SW or W and 3ft forget it. Blown out, frustrating, and just crap when it gets near or over shoulder high."
